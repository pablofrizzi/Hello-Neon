# Hello Neon

This is a PSD project I found (https://the-awwwesomes.gitbooks.io/html-css-step-by-step/content/pl/appendix/layouts/index.html) and converted it to HTML. I used BOOTSTRAP grid to provide it responsiveness. I also made few changes in the project regarding fonts and social menu placement.
